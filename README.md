# Transport-Tephra-CA
An OpenCL 1.2 cellular automata to modelize the volcanic tephra's transport

The aim of this work was to implement a cellular automata on GPUs, written in C++ and OpenCL, 
of the tephra fragment transportation model submitted by PhD. J.-L. Falcone of Geneva 
University - Earth Sciences Department

I implement this OpenCL CA for my bachelor thesis
